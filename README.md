# Employee
BU MET CS231 Project 1

Create an Employee class (using specification and implementation files) that includes three private attributes – a first name of type string, a last name of type string and a monthly salary of type double.

The class should have a constructor that initializes the three private attributes.  Additionally, provide a set and a get method for each attribute. The set method for the salary attribute must guard against negative input values.

Write a test program that demonstrates the class Employee’s capabilities by first creating two Employee objects. Then, display each employee’s first and last name, as well as the employee’s yearly salary.  Finally, give each employee a 10 percent raise and again display each employee’s yearly salary.

Some examples of utilizing the class Employee:

// Create two employees
Employee  e1("John", "Doe", 12345.67);
Employee  e2("Jane", "Jones", 76543.21);

// Display employees' info

// Give raise

// Display yearly salary

// Change Jane's last name to "Doe"

// Display Jane's info
